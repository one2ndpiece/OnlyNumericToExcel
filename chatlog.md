## USER
Use the python program to output only the numeric portion to excel.
However, numbers on the same line should be output column-wise.
think step by step.
if you find numeric value including negative ones, output it to excel.
if you find another one in the same line, output it to next column.
if you find another one in different,output it to next row of column1.

## ASSISTANT
Here is a Python script that parses a text file for numbers, including negative ones, and writes them into an Excel file using pandas. This script assumes that your text file has numbers separated by non-numeric characters and possibly by new lines. It uses regular expressions (re module in Python) to find these numbers.

This code reads a file line by line, finds all numbers in a line, and stores them. It then uses the pandas DataFrame to create an Excel file from the numbers found.

```python
import re
import pandas as pd

def extract_numbers(file_name):
    data = []

    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Finding all numbers including negative numbers
            numbers = re.findall(r'-?\d+\.?\d*', line)
            # Converting all found strings to floats or integers
            numbers = [float(num) if '.' in num else int(num) for num in numbers]
            data.append(numbers)

    return data

# Replace with your text file name
file_name = 'your_text_file.txt'
data = extract_numbers(file_name)

# Creating a pandas DataFrame from the list of lists
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Writing the DataFrame to an Excel file
df.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False, header=False)
```

This code will create an `output.xlsx` file where each number in a line of text is put into a separate column, and each line is a separate row. Please replace `'your_text_file.txt'` with the name of your text file.

This script doesn't deal with complex scenarios like numbers being part of a larger non-numeric string. Please be sure to adjust it according to your needs.

UnicodeDecodeError: 'cp932' codec can't decode byte 0x86 in position 2: illegal multibyte sequence

## ASSISTANT
The error message you're seeing is due to Python's inability to decode the file's contents with the encoding set as 'cp932'. This typically happens when you try to open a file that contains non-Japanese characters encoded in 'cp932'.

You can try to open the file with a different encoding. One common encoding for files that include multi-language contents is 'utf-8'. Here is the updated code:

```python
import re
import pandas as pd

def extract_numbers(file_name):
    data = []

    with open(file_name, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Finding all numbers including negative numbers
            numbers = re.findall(r'-?\d+\.?\d*', line)
            # Converting all found strings to floats or integers
            numbers = [float(num) if '.' in num else int(num) for num in numbers]
            data.append(numbers)

    return data

# Replace with your text file name
file_name = 'your_text_file.txt'
data = extract_numbers(file_name)

# Creating a pandas DataFrame from the list of lists
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Writing the DataFrame to an Excel file
df.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False, header=False)
```

In this code, the `open()` function is supplied with an additional `encoding='utf-8'` argument. This tells Python to open the file using the UTF-8 encoding, which should allow it to properly handle a wider range of characters.

Please replace `'your_text_file.txt'` with the name of your text file. If you still get the same error, it means that the file is not UTF-8 encoded. You may want to try other encodings like 'iso-8859-1' (also known as 'latin1'), 'cp1252', etc., or identify the correct encoding of the file.

## USER
ignore error

## ASSISTANT
If you'd like to ignore the decoding error, you can use the `errors='ignore'` parameter in the `open` function. This will replace any non-decodable bytes with Python's undefined character. However, be aware that this might lead to data loss as it simply ignores any characters that can't be decoded.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import re
import pandas as pd

def extract_numbers(file_name):
    data = []

    with open(file_name, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Finding all numbers including negative numbers
            numbers = re.findall(r'-?\d+\.?\d*', line)
            # Converting all found strings to floats or integers
            numbers = [float(num) if '.' in num else int(num) for num in numbers]
            data.append(numbers)

    return data

# Replace with your text file name
file_name = 'your_text_file.txt'
data = extract_numbers(file_name)

# Creating a pandas DataFrame from the list of lists
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Writing the DataFrame to an Excel file
df.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False, header=False)
```

In this script, `errors='ignore'` in `open()` makes Python replace any undecodable bytes with Python's undefined character. As said before, using this approach might result in data loss.
